# Code for evaluating the performance of ten prediction algorithms on clinically relevant missense variants

This repository contains code for the project "Comprehensive Evaluation of the Performance of Prediction Algorithms on Clinically Relevant Missense Variants". This source code was used for the statistical evaluation of the algorithms, ROC generation, and data visualization.

## Data Availability
The four datasets, "Expert Panel", "CircD", "BRCA1", and "BRCA2" used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms were retrieved from the public repository ClinVar using well defined filtering criteria. The datasets can be downloaded from the following Zenodo repository under the doi: 10.5281/zenodo.8000288.
